## Installation Instructions

### Method 1: Arduino IDE Library Manager
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries
3. Search for each library name above
4. Click Install for each required library

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1. Download library ZIP files from GitHub
2. Go to Sketch → Include Library → Add .ZIP Library
3. Select the downloaded ZIP file

## ESP32 Board Package
Add this URL to Additional Board Manager URLs:
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

Then install "ESP32 by Espressif Systems" from Boards Manager

## Verification
After installation, compile firmware/basketball_free_throw.ino
All libraries should be found without errors.

## Troubleshooting
- If library not found: Check spelling and try different versions
- If compile errors: Update to latest library versions
- If upload fails: Check board selection and COM port
